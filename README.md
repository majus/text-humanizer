StealthHumanizer is an open-source web application for rewriting AI-generated text into more human-like writing with configurable tone, style, and rewrite intensity, plus an integrated detection and readability analysis layer.

## Features

- Multi-provider generation pipeline with support for free and paid model providers.
- Multiple rewrite levels (including multi-pass modes) to control transformation strength.
- Preset writing styles and tone controls for output targeting.
- Built-in detector with multiple heuristics and readability scoring.
- Side-by-side workflow for source text, transformed output, and quality feedback.
- Browser-first key handling to keep user API keys local to the client.

## Architecture

High-level architecture:

1. **UI layer (`components/`, `app/page.tsx`)** handles text entry, settings, and result rendering.
2. **API routes (`app/api/`)** orchestrate provider calls and rewrite workflows.
3. **Core logic (`lib/`)** provides prompt construction, provider abstraction, detector scoring, and storage helpers.
4. **Research and evaluation scripts (`scripts/`, `data/`)** support benchmark and training smoke pipelines.
5. **Documentation (`docs/`)** provides user and contributor guides published through GitHub Pages.

For deeper technical details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) and [STYLE_ENGINE.md](./STYLE_ENGINE.md).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudra496/StealthHumanizer.git
cd StealthHumanizer
npm ci
```

## Quickstart

Run the application locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`, add a provider API key in settings, and run a rewrite.

## Configuration

StealthHumanizer is configured primarily through UI controls and local browser storage.

- **Provider keys:** configured in app settings and stored locally.
- **Rewrite strategy:** choose level, style, tone, and target score.
- **Research pipeline scripts:** use JSON configs under `data/papers/*.config.example.json` and `data/models/*.config.example.json`.

See [docs/configuration.md](./docs/configuration.md) for full details.

## Usage Examples

### Application usage

1. Paste AI-generated text.
2. Select rewrite level, style, and tone.
3. Run humanization.
4. Review detector/readability scores and iterate.


### One-command legal corpus + training bootstrap (ready-made)

For a complete local run (install + ingest + benchmark + train + eval) using the built-in open-access/Q1-oriented configs:

```bash
npm run pipeline:q1-ready
```

Faster reruns (skip reinstall):

```bash
npm run pipeline:q1-ready:skip-install
```

The wrapper (`scripts/papers/complete-ready-pipeline.mjs`) runs:

1. `npm ci` (unless `--skip-install`)
2. `node scripts/papers/batch-download-and-train.mjs` with Q1 OA configs
3. `node scripts/model/evaluate-framework.mjs --manifest data/models/current/run.manifest.json`

If ingestion fails due to provider/network limits, the batch stage falls back to a small bundled open-source seed set so the full pipeline can still complete.

For very large corpora (for example, ~10k papers), keep PDFs/fulltext artifacts in object storage and track only configs/manifests in Git.

### Scripted benchmark/training smoke flow

```bash
npm run papers:benchmark -- --config data/papers/benchmark.smoke.config.json --run-id local-smoke
npm run model:train -- --config data/models/train.smoke.config.json --run-id local-smoke
npm run model:eval -- --manifest data/models/current/run.manifest.json
```

## Testing and Local Development

Common commands:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test:integration
npm run build
```

Notes:

- `npm run test:integration` expects generated benchmark/model manifests.
