// ==================== STYLE PROMPTS ====================

const STYLE_GUIDES: Record<StylePreset, string> = {
  humanize: `HUMANIZE STYLE RULES — OPTIMIZED FOR BYPASSING AI DETECTION:
- Your #1 priority is making text that reads as HUMAN-WRITTEN, not just "good writing"
- Use contractions everywhere (don't, can't, it's, they're, wouldn't've, could've, should've, that's)
- Start sentences with conjunctions (And, But, So, Because, Also, Plus, Or, Well)
- Dramatically vary sentence length: 3-word fragments, 25-word flowing sentences, 8-word punchy ones
- Add natural imperfections: slightly informal word in a formal context, a sentence that trails off with "..."
- Include personal asides in parentheses (like this) or em-dashes—like this
- Use "I", "we", "you" naturally throughout
- Avoid ALL AI-typical phrases: "furthermore", "moreover", "additionally", "in conclusion", "it is important to note", "delve into", "tapestry", "in today's world", "landscape", "realm"
- Never start two consecutive sentences the same way
- End some paragraphs with a question or an unexpected thought (never with a summary)
- Include at least one rhetorical question per section
- Use filler words sparingly but naturally (basically, honestly, kind of, pretty much, you know)
- Mix formal and informal elements — humans don't write in one consistent register
- Add occasional humor, irony, or personality
- Break rules intentionally for effect: one-word paragraphs, sentence fragments, dramatic pauses`,

  academic: `ACADEMIC STYLE RULES:
- Maintain scholarly rigor while sounding natural
- Use field-specific terminology naturally, not as decoration
- Include hedging language ("may", "might", "could suggest", "one could argue")
- Reference ideas conversationally: "as Smith (2023) points out" not "According to the research conducted by Smith (2023)"
- Vary between complex analytical sentences and simple declarative ones
- Occasionally use "I" or "we" when making analytical points
- Avoid robotic lists of transitions - use natural connective tissue
- Write paragraphs of varying lengths (2-6 sentences)
- End paragraphs with something interesting, not just summaries
- Use em-dashes and semicolons naturally
- Include occasional rhetorical questions to engage the reader
- Numbers under 10 should be spelled out ("three studies" not "3 studies")`,

  casual: `CASUAL STYLE RULES:
- Write exactly like you'd explain this to a smart friend over coffee
- Use contractions constantly (don't, can't, it's, they're, wouldn't've, could've)
- Start sentences with conjunctions (And, But, So, Because, Also)
- Use informal transitions (anyway, so, basically, honestly, moving on)
- Add filler words naturally but sparingly (like, you know, I mean, kind of)
- Mix very short sentences with longer ones. Dramatically.
- Use parentheses for asides (like this) and em-dashes for emphasis—like this
- Occasionally use "stuff" or "things" when specificity doesn't matter
- Include personal opinions naturally: "I think the most interesting part is..."
- Use slang that fits the context but nothing too niche
- Sentence fragments are totally fine. Especially for emphasis.
- Don't be afraid to start a paragraph with "Anyway" or "OK so"`,

  professional: `PROFESSIONAL STYLE RULES:
- Clear, direct, no fluff — every word earns its place
- Use active voice predominantly but passive when the action matters more than the actor
- Professional but warm — not corporate robot
- Short paragraphs, clear topic sentences
- Use specific numbers and data points ("increased revenue by 23%")
- Avoid buzzwords (synergy, leverage, paradigm shift) unless genuinely useful
- Use bullet points and numbered lists when they add clarity
- Signpost transitions clearly but not mechanically
- End sections with action items or clear takeaways
- Use "we" and "our" for organizational context
- Be concise — if you can say it in fewer words, do it`,

  creative: `CREATIVE STYLE RULES:
- Prioritize vivid, engaging language over information density
- Use sensory details — what would the reader see, hear, feel?
- Metaphors and similes that are fresh, not cliché
- Vary sentence rhythm like music — staccato shorts, flowing longs
- Use unexpected word choices that still feel natural
- Show rather than tell whenever possible
- Create moments of tension and release in the prose
- Use dialogue formatting for key points when appropriate
- Break rules intentionally for effect (fragments, run-ons, one-word paragraphs)
- The writing should have a distinctive voice and personality`,

  technical: `TECHNICAL STYLE RULES:
- Precision is paramount — every term must be correct
- Use concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts
- Define terms on first use, then use them naturally after
- Structure with clear hierarchy (headings, subheadings, numbered steps)
- Use code blocks, diagrams references, or analogies for complex ideas
- Balance accessibility with accuracy — explain simply but correctly
- Use "you" to address the reader directly
- Keep sentences focused — one idea per sentence
- Use parallel structure in lists and procedures
- Anticipate reader questions and address them preemptively`,
};

// ==================== REWRITE LEVEL INSTRUCTIONS ====================

const LEVEL_INSTRUCTIONS: Record<RewriteLevel, string> = {
  light: `REWRITE LEVEL: LIGHT — Subtle, surgical changes only.
GOALS:
- Add contractions where missing (it is → it's, do not → don't, cannot → can't)
- Replace stiff phrasing: "utilize" → "use", "implement" → "set up", "facilitate" → "help"
- Add informal transitions sparingly: "Also," "Plus," "And," instead of "Furthermore,"
- Break sentences over 25 words into two shorter ones
- Combine 2-3 very short sentences into one longer flowing sentence
- Fix overly perfect parallel structure — introduce minor asymmetry
- Replace "in order to" with "to", "due to the fact that" with "because"
- Add occasional em-dashes for natural pauses
CONSTRAINTS: Keep same paragraph structure. Same number of paragraphs. Same overall flow. Same meaning. Just make it read 5-10% more naturally.`,

  medium: `REWRITE LEVEL: MEDIUM — Noticeable humanization.
GOALS:
- Restructure at least 30% of sentences for better flow and variation
- Vary sentence lengths dramatically: some 3-5 words, some 20-30 words
- Change passive to active voice in at least 40% of cases (and vice versa for variety)
- Add 2-3 personal touches or asides per paragraph
- Insert natural imperfections: a sentence that trails off, a parenthetical comment
- Replace ALL formal transition words with informal ones or restructure to avoid them
- Add filler words sparingly: "basically", "honestly", "kind of", "in a way"
- Start at least 2 paragraphs differently than the original (not with "The" or "In")
- Add at least one rhetorical question per section
- Spell out numbers under 100
- Include at least one first-person reference per 200 words
CONSTRAINTS: Preserve all facts and key information. Core meaning must be identical. Structure can change moderately.`,

  aggressive: `REWRITE LEVEL: AGGRESSIVE — Complete rewrite from scratch.
GOALS:
- Rewrite the ENTIRE text as if a human wrote it from scratch with the same information
- Adopt a strong personal voice with opinions and personality
- Dramatically vary paragraph lengths: some 1-2 sentences, some 6-8 sentences
- Use sentence fragments, questions, exclamations, and run-ons intentionally
- Add colloquialisms and conversational phrasing throughout
- Include natural tangents, digressions, and asides (in parentheses or em-dashes)
- Use "I", "we", "you" liberally even in formal contexts
- Start paragraphs with conjunctions (And, But, So, Because, Also, Plus)
- Add at least 2 "imperfect" elements per paragraph (informal word, trailing thought, repetition for emphasis)
- Replace EVERY formal word with a common equivalent
- Use rhetorical questions as paragraph openers at least twice
- Include subtle humor, irony, or personality even in serious contexts
- Break academic conventions deliberately (one-word paragraphs, dramatic pauses)
CONSTRAINTS: Every fact and idea from the original must be present. No new information. No removed information. The voice changes completely, the meaning stays identical.`,

  ninja: `REWRITE LEVEL: NINJA — Maximum stealth humanization.
This is the MAXIMUM humanization mode. Your goal is to produce text that closely resembles human writing.

TECHNIQUES TO EMPLOY (use ALL of these):
1. CONTROLLED IMPERFECTION: Include 1-2 subtle "mistakes" that real humans make:
   - A slightly ambiguous pronoun reference
   - A sentence that could be more concise
   - An opinion stated as fact (humans do this constantly)
   - A slightly informal word in a formal context (or vice versa)

2. BURSTINESS ENGINEERING:
   - Create EXTREME sentence length variation (3 words → 35 words → 5 words → 28 words)
   - Mix sentence types: declarative, interrogative, imperative, exclamatory, fragment
   - Never have two consecutive sentences of similar length

3. PERPLEXITY MANIPULATION:
   - Use unexpected but natural word choices ("peculiar" instead of "unusual")
   - Include idiomatic expressions naturally ("hit the nail on the head")
   - Reference specific, concrete details instead of generalities
   - Use domain-specific slang or jargon naturally

4. ANTI-PATTERN AVOIDANCE (NEVER do these):
   - Never use: "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally", "In conclusion", "It is important to note"
   - Never start two sentences in a paragraph the same way
   - Never use more than one transition word per paragraph
   - Never end a paragraph with a summary statement
   - Never use the "In today's world" or "In the modern era" pattern
   - Never use "delve", "tapestry", "realm", "landscape" as metaphors

5. HUMAN VOICE INJECTION:
   - Write as if explaining to a specific person you know
   - Include a brief anecdote or hypothetical scenario
   - Add an opinion that a human would naturally have
   - Use hedging selectively and naturally ("probably", "I'd guess", "seems like")
   - Include at least one parenthetical aside per paragraph

6. STRUCTURAL REWRITE:
   - Completely reorganize paragraph order if it makes sense
   - Merge or split paragraphs freely
   - Use non-linear information presentation (mention result, then explain)
   - Add transitional phrases that only humans use ("OK so", "Anyway", "Here's where it gets interesting")

TARGET: The text should score 90%+ on any AI detector while maintaining perfect meaning preservation.`,

// ==================== SAMPLE TEXT ====================

export const SAMPLE_AI_TEXT = `Artificial intelligence has revolutionized the way businesses operate in the modern era. The implementation of AI technologies has facilitated unprecedented advancements in automation, data analysis, and customer service. Organizations that utilize artificial intelligence are able to optimize their operations and achieve superior outcomes.

Furthermore, the utilization of machine learning algorithms has enabled companies to process vast quantities of data with remarkable efficiency. This capability has proven to be particularly beneficial in the realm of predictive analytics, wherein organizations can anticipate market trends and consumer behavior with considerable accuracy.

In addition to these advantages, artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in the domain of content creation. Natural language processing technologies have evolved to the extent that they are capable of generating human-like text that is virtually indistinguishable from content authored by human writers. This development has profound implications for various industries, including journalism, marketing, and entertainment.

It is important to note that the integration of AI systems requires careful consideration of ethical implications. Organizations must ensure that their AI implementations are transparent, fair, and accountable. Additionally, the potential impact on employment must be addressed through proactive workforce development initiatives.`;
